This role will primarily mentor, coach and motivate the team, alongside some technical work such as code review and writing technical proposals.</p>\n<p>As a Software Engineering Manager and part of the engineering team at Overleaf, you will be helping to make Overleaf the go-to place for scientific writing by both inspiring your engineers to do their best work, and making your own contributions directly to the platform.</p>\n<p>Your responsibilities will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold regular 1:1s with your engineers</li>\n<li>Motivate them to do their best work</li>\n<li>Nurture them through their career progression and development</li>\n<li>Provide mentorship and coaching, pointing them at relevant training when needed</li>\n<li>Advocate for them during planning to ensure they get assigned to the right projects</li>\n<li>Provide constructive feedback and manage performance issues where necessary</li>\n<li>Input into the decision-making process when choosing which projects and features to work on</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Sit on hiring panels</li>\n<li>Review pull requests from other engineers (primarily in JavaScript)</li>\n<li>Take on a high-level tech-lead role for individual projects and features</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key projects on our road map this year include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consolidate our two project history systems ‚Äî we currently have two from our integration with ShareLaTeX in 2017, each with hundreds of TB to be consolidated</li>\n<li>Make our project PDF preview faster and less bandwidth-hungry ‚Äî we have prototypes showing big wins that now need getting ready for production</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the longer term, we are planning projects around improved collaboration features for teams, improvements to our rich text mode to help non-LaTeX users, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Tech</strong></p>\n<p>Overleaf is based on open-source software, and most of our product code is itself open source. You can find it on GitHub:<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf</a></p>\n<p>We run a microservices architecture, mainly in Node.js using MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Redis, running on Google Kubernetes Engine.

In each cycle, we have multiple delivery tracks, each with its own tech lead. Engineers move between delivery teams each cycle. We practice code review, invest in automated testing and are big fans of linting.</p>\n<p><strong>How We Hire</strong></p>\n<p>The stages in our hiring process are typically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We will aim to update you on the status of your application within 2 working days from when we receive it.</li>\n<li>There may be a 15-minute screening call with an internal recruiter to discuss what it is you‚Äôre looking for</li>\n<li>We‚Äôll schedule a 30-minute call for a discussion with our Engineering Director to discuss the role and your experience, to see if they look like a good fit.</li>\n<li>We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically two hours long. The first hour is discussion, and the second hour is based on a short homework assignment (max 2h outside of interview) or an exercise during the interview if you prefer. The problems are practical in nature and do not require writing code.</li>\n<li>We‚Äôll schedule a call with a small group of engineers, so you can get a feel for who you would be working with</li>\n<li>We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>We require that you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have some experience with leading or coaching engineers and/or working with them on their career development\n<ul>\n<li>Experience of line management is a plus, but we are also happy to consider candidates with less formal leadership experience</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Have 2‚Äì3 years of experience working as a senior engineer on a SaaS-like product.\n<ul>\n<li>Experience with JavaScript and Node.js is a plus but not essential</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Will work for us full time (or nearly full time)</li>\n<li>Are based in the US, Canada, the UK or Europe (EU member state)</li>\n<li>Will usually be available in our core hours, 2pm‚Äì5pm UK time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Experience with the technologies we use helps, but you don't need to know them all; your ability to learn is much more important to us.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote and flexible working.</li>\n<li>Salary ¬£80k‚Äì¬£95k per year depending on experience.</li>\n<li>You would join a small, dedicated and growing team.</li>\n<li>We're substantially (around 80%) open-source, so your work will often be on open source code.</li>\n<li>We get everyone together in London for team meetings several times a year for valuable face-to-face time (pandemic permitting).</li>\n<li>We‚Äôll provide a new Mac, PC or Linux laptop, along with a stipend for other equipment.</li>\n<li>We provide a training budget and allocate time for training; many of our developers choose to attend relevant industry conferences or buy training materials.</li>\n<li>We run regular <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleafs-remote-hackathon-revisited-one-year\" rel=\"nofollow\">remote hackathons</a> to keep learning and experimenting.</li>\n<li>We run a weekly internal seminar series with short talks from staff about their work or personal projects, new technologies and techniques.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We're an equal opportunity employer.

With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of ~55 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Our app‚Äôs frontend is a single-page JavaScript web app mostly written in React (originally built with <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"http://backbone.js/\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"color: #737578; text-decoration: underline;\">Backbone.js</a>). We bundle with Webpack and target only modern browsers. We test with Jest and React Testing Library. Our UI updates in near real-time and is written in LESS/CSS (with flexbox and grid layout) using CSS modules and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code. We sweat the UI/UX details and work collaboratively with the Product team throughout the design process. This means diving into lo-fi Freehand wireframes, and communicating continuously when those ideas are brought to life using Figma and code.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Our frontend app is built on top of our REST API &amp; GraphQL endpoints. Our backend <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"color: #737578; text-decoration: underline;\">tech stack</a> consists of Python/Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis.

We bundle with Webpack and target only modern browsers. We test with Jest and React Testing Library. Our UI updates in near real-time and is written in LESS/CSS (with flexbox and grid layout) using CSS modules and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC. </p><br><p>We care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code. We sweat the UI/UX details and work collaboratively with the Product team throughout the design process. This means diving into lo-fi wireframes, and communicating continuously when those ideas are brought to life using Figma and code.</p><br><p>Our frontend app is built on top of our REST API &amp; GraphQL endpoints.

Paired with a strong developer community, we believe in growing an ecosystem of productivity tools for individuals and teams. After we released our API, our community jumped on it and built ~200 extensions within weeks. They are eager to integrate with their tools and <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/tonka3000/snake\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; text-decoration: none; transition: color var(--theme-transition);\" target=\"_blank\">find creative new ways to use Raycast</a>.

We're empowering creatives around the world to make a living doing what they love. Our mission is to provide support at every stage of a creative's journey; whether that's freelancing, selling their physical and digital goods on our marketplace, or being hired by some of the world's leading design-forward companies.</p>\n<p>With many jobs, you have to pick between having a huge impact on the organization (small team) or having a huge impact on the world (big product), but at Dribbble - you get to do both, as part of a highly collaborative team, working on one of the world's top 1000 websites.</p>\n<p>At Dribbble, we serve a global community and we need a diverse team to do that successfully. Women, people of colour, members of the LGBTQ+ community, individuals with disabilities, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply.

We're dedicated to fostering an inclusive and diverse environment for employees from all walks of life.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôre building a fully remote team across North America (Canada &amp; the US).

Your desire to help your team be better and stronger is a driving factor at Dribbble.</li>\n<li><strong>Passion in developing the skills and talents of those on your team</strong> and being a player-coach. You can help promote an inspiring and inclusive environment for the team.</li>\n<li><strong>A self starter.</strong> We're not big on micromanaging around here, so you're comfortable managing your own time, working independently, while knowing when to ask for help.</li>\n<li><strong>A problem solver</strong>. Working at the scale that we do, we need an engineer who loves working with their team to determine smart solutions for our users.</li>\n<li><strong>A solid team mate.</strong> Whether it be in code reviews, pair programming or just chatting with your colleagues, the desire to help your team be better and stronger is a driving factor at Dribbble.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>At Dribbble, you‚Äôll join a diverse team dedicated to learning, teaching, and growing; as individuals, as a team, as a business, and as a community.

Our music software is the end result of having a great team. The team is always more important than the product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Our motto is: we never copy another company's work. If someone has built a similar idea already, we're never going to build the same idea ourselves. All our work is 100% innovative and original because that's the rule we made 16 years ago. We have a track record to prove it. It makes the job super interesting because we're always \"first\" to do something and it makes our work unique.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4. You'll learn a lot from this job</strong></p>\n<p>Our software is more complex than most products. You'll learn a lot from working on it. We have a great team dynamic and we always learn from each other. Everyone on the team has enough experience to be called a \"Senior\" developer. </p>\n<p><strong>5. We make tools for the world's biggest musicians</strong></p>\n<p>Our testimonial list is awesome: <a href=\"https://mixedinkey.com/artist-reviews-of-mixed-in-key\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://mixedinkey.com/artist-reviews-of-mixed-in-key</a>/</p>\n<p>These are not paid endorsements, they are just quotes from fans of the product.</p>\n<p>All our software is written in C# on Windows and Objective-C on Mac. If you join our C# team, you'll work directly on building this software and future generations of it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6. What are we looking for? </strong></p>\n<p>1) It's required that you have a solid knowledge of C# and that you enjoy using it. It's our language of choice. We hire people who feel the same way about it.</p>\n<p>2) No music knowledge is required - if you've never composed music before, that's OK with us. We can teach you what you'll need to know about making music.</p>\n<p>3) You must have at least some experience in building complex software. For developers who've only built basic apps, this job is going to be way too hard. On average, our team members have 10+ years of programming experience, and several have 20-30+ years each. We're a group of experienced people.</p>\n<p>4) It helps if you take a lot of initiative. The job is \"remote work only\", so you need to be good at managing your own time and being productive every day at working remotely.</p>\n<p>5) Desire to work from home. You can work 4 days a week (Tuesday-Friday, or Monday-Thursday), or 5 days a week depending on your preference. We don't hire for less than 32 hours per week</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7. Salary:</strong></p>\n<p>We pay Western European  / US rates, even for people who live outside the US. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If this sounds interesting and you want to work in C# on creative software, please get in touch with us. We have a spot open because we're growing. Thanks!</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1219107/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"

As a public benefit corporation, our intent is not to win as much work as we can, but to design a portfolio that makes the highest leverage progress against that mission. </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"\">Nava has a role in every important program that serves vulnerable populations and can apply industry-level ecosystem pressure to transform service experiences, program outcomes, and agency adaptability.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"\">Nava is at the forefront of reimagining how our government serves its people, and we're looking for experienced researchers to help drive this mission forward.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"\">You will work on a cross-functional team to build scalable digital services for our government - designing, implementing, and delivering software that is depended on by millions of Americans. You care deeply about working on technology that affects people's lives, and are passionate about building large-scale systems that are well-designed, fast, scalable, and secure.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"\">Below are some of the traits of candidates who will likely be successful in this role. If you're excited about this opportunity but don't think you meet all of the requirements, apply anyway!</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong style=\"\">What You'll Do</strong></div>\n<div><span style=\"\">We're looking for talented engineers to solve technical challenges across the stack, including those who lean more towards front-end or back-end development. Working together, our engineering team presents end-to-end solutions that will be used by millions of Americans every day.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong style=\"\">On the back end:</strong></div>\n<div><span style=\"\">You will build new systems with modern technology within the existing ecosystem of legacy government systems. Our work is to build functional, resilient software for production so that vital services are consistently available to those who need them. This usually means getting to know legacy systems and determining how to replicate the system's behavior or how to integrate with these systems. If you care deeply about how software systems work over time, and building systems for longevity and resilience, this work is for you.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"\">You will be working within the government ecosystem, which means working, sometimes closely, with other government contractors and civil servants. Working with people outside of your company means you'll likely encounter different working styles and cultural norms. At the same time, working as part of a larger team allows us to deliver on projects of larger scale and complexity.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"\">The government also imposes a level of bureaucracy that is typically not present in a company of our size in the private sector. We operate in a regulated environment, where checks and compliance is built into the process of building software. This can make the path to production slower and some decisions, such as tools and processes, lie outside of our control. However, beyond writing code, finding and recommending ways to improve the way government software is built is one of the highest-leverage ways we help fulfill our mission.</span></div>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Role and Responsibilities</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Work with fellow Nava engineers to design, review, and build well-crafted software.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Collaborate with government partners and other contractors to architect, implement, and deploy new systems and improvements to existing systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Work in an agile manner to efficiently ship new features that meet user needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Create tools and processes to automate our development, testing, and production workflows.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Participate in an on-call rotation to support production systems and investigate issues when they occur.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Take part in hiring activities (e.g., submitting referrals, conducting interviews, and attending interview debriefs), as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Required Skills</div>\n<ul>\n<li> Experience in back-end programming in Node, Python, or Java</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Meaningful experience working on web-based systems on the back-end</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience working on large-scale applications and systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>An adaptive, empathetic, collaborative and positive mindset.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to think holistically around engineering issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Knowledge of engineering fundamentals and architecture. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Expertise developing well-crafted software.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills, technical and otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience with modern web development frameworks.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience designing and implementing application architectures and code that is highly scalable, available, and performant.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Self-directed, requiring minimal supervision.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Other Requirements</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience: Minimum of 2 years</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Residency: Lived in United States at least 3 years out of the last 5 years</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Education: Due to contractual requirements, this role requires a Bachelor's Degree (in any discipline) or 4 years of experience in lieu of a degree.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be required to obtain a public trust clearance.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel: Occasional travel to government partner offices or Nava offices in SF, DC, or NY may be required on a project to project basis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Things that are not important to us:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether or not you have a CS or engineering degree.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether or not you have Github contributions.

Founded in 2009, and with offices in San Francisco, Budapest and Riga, Prezi provides its users a visually engaging, personalized way to express their ideas anytime, anywhere.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 32px; color: #374050;\">The company‚Äôs vision extends well beyond authoring software alone into becoming the inspiration and enabler of world-changing ideas for people, organizations, and businesses. Prezi has enjoyed explosive growth and developed a rapid following of passionate users. More than 85 million people from over 190 countries use Prezi from their desktops, browsers and mobile devices. Prezi is rapidly adding new users each month, and more than 1 Prezi is created every second. The company has over 300 employees and is backed by premier investors, including Accel Partners, Sunstone Capital (based in Copenhagen), and TED. We are looking for a talented software engineer to join our Data Infrastructure Team.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\" style=\"font-weight: 500; line-height: 30px; color: #374050; margin-bottom: 20px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Data @ Prezi</span></div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 32px; color: #374050;\">We believe that data analytics should be easy for both technical and non-technical people. We aim to create the tools, build the data platform and train our users to make this possible.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 32px; color: #374050;\">To better understand our users we collect data from all parts of our product and push it to a Kafka cluster and ingest data to Amazon distributed storage S3. We then use open source tools like Apache Gobblin to further process and analyze our data. We collect around 1TB data/day. Analysts who are interested in the data can crunch the data using Zeppelin or can schedule jobs with our ETL system to process the data with Spark/Trino. Data is then exposed through Hive tables for further analyses and reporting.

A¬∑Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A¬∑Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A¬∑Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;\">\n<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>\n<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A¬∑Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>\n<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere.

Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if you meet these criteria:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>About You</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>You love code</strong>. You love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>You value collaboration</strong>. You understand that building modern software is a team sport, and you enjoy working as part of a tight-knit team. You‚Äôre happy to pitch in and help the team, whether by reviewing code, pairing on a tricky problem, or just thinking about how to solve the challenges we‚Äôre facing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>You can balance lots of concerns</strong>. Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, accessibility, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>You advocate for the user</strong>. You have a keen eye for great design, and you‚Äôre empathetic to the needs of the end user. When you see users struggling to succeed you take it as a personal challenge to understand why and help the team build a better product.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>You love learning new things</strong>. You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Python, CSS, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don't already know it, you're ready to learn it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Things You Might Do</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Research, guide, and execute frontend architecture changes, including but by no means limited to GraphQL, server-side React rendering and TypeScript typing.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Work with stakeholders (other Zapier teams, or external partners) to understand requirements, propose solutions, and build something to help those stakeholders succeed.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Contribute to improving NextJS apps by building reusable React components with modular CSS. Ensure reliable code by leveraging Jest and Cypress tests.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Measure and resolve performance bottlenecks, using tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPagetest, or custom tooling.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Refactor or improve existing code as languages, frameworks, or techniques evolve. Help the team pick appropriate tools to solve new problems as they arise.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to help us become a better, more effective organisation.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Help teach your colleagues new skills, through code review, discussions and mentoring. Help us all become better engineers and humans.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a part of Zapier's <a href=\"https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fzapier.com%2Flearn%2Fcustomer-support%2Feveryone-on-support%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">all-hands philosophy</a>, help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You‚Äôll also have the opportunity to specialize in a variety of areas of the Zapier codebase. Focusing on a specialization will not limit your growth at Zapier as we believe that each engineer brings a unique perspective and can contribute in all areas. We encourage collaboration and will frequently have engineers contribute across teams to assist with projects.</p><br>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Whole Package</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Location:</strong> Remote</p>\n<p>Our flexible, distributed environment lets us work with the best people from around the world.

Millions of people spend hours each day rekeying data from documents and manually cataloguing paperwork. Impira allows nontechnical users to extract clean and structured data from files using artificial intelligence, making these processes instant and automatic. In just a few minutes, a user can drag-and-drop files into Impira, label a few examples, and sit back while Impira takes care of the rest.  </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Under the hood, the Impira platform consists of advanced machine learning, database, and UI technology. Our key innovation is one-shot learning which allows a machine to learn from just one data point (in real time) and continue to learn from every interaction. One-shot learning is what allows users to extract data within five minutes of making an account. As you can imagine, this powerful innovation can drive automation for a litany of business processes across nearly any industry, allowing orgs to recover countless work hours. We're proud to not only meaningfully impact companies' bottom line but also boost employee morale and creativity with our product.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Delivering an elegant, simple user experience for extracting data from complex documents is no easy task and it requires heavy collaboration across disciplines.

          "description": "<p>At Ziglu, we‚Äôre building the next generation of financial services and we‚Äôre looking for experienced software engineers who want to join us on this journey. We provide simple, safe and affordable access to the major crypto and fiat currencies, alongside traditional banking services, foreign exchange and (soon) investments/wealth products. We embrace regulation with active EMI and permanent crypto asset registration with the FCA in the UK and relevant regulators in Europe, making us one of the first fully regulated, crypto-supporting challengers in the UK, and well-placed to grow and become a worldwide leader in financial services.</p>\n<p>We are looking to add experienced software engineers to our Payments and Cards team to build and scale our payment rails integrations. This involves building new integrations as we scale to new territories and integrate with new platforms, technologies and payment rails, all of which enables us to reach more customers and enable them flexibility in making and receiving payments with their Ziglu accounts.</p>\n<p>We hire from a variety of backgrounds and care about your experience and motivations more than your formal qualifications. We don't need you to have experience in the finance sector. If you are motivated, eager to learn, value the opportunity to work autonomously in a fast-paced organisation, and you are driven by the outcomes you can achieve for our customers, we want to hear from you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h3\">About the role</div>\n<p>You will contribute to the design, build and ongoing operation of our back-end payments processing platforms, including our core ledger and its integration with a variety of third-party payments systems. The ledger is our most important asset ‚Äì it tracks customer funds in the system. Our integrations with a variety of third-party systems support the deposit, withdrawal and payments journeys within the Ziglu app, which is one of our most essential user journeys (the other being the <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://apply.workable.com/ziglu/j/2E07E98CC3/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">exchange flow</a>). We are one of a small number of financial technology firms that operates our own entirely cloud-based core banking platform, giving us full autonomy over the end-to-end delivery of every feature and aspect of our product ‚Äì we don't buy our core platform from a third party.</p>\n<p>We're currently integrated with the main UK fiat banking rails (FPS and BACS), we run our own Mastercard debit card integration, and we're planning several new integrations as we expand to new territories and integrate with emerging payments technologies and platforms. The banking system is complex and our payments engineers do a great job of developing and managing solutions to manage and abstract that complexity within our wider technology stack.</p>\n<p>All engineers on the team support their code from ideation, through build and into production. We trust you to organise your work and hours to achieve the best company outcomes. We support a hybrid working culture ‚Äì although we have an office in London where you can work, we also support remote-first anywhere in the UK and EU, provided you're situated within UTC-2 to UTC+1. We're comfortable working remotely ‚Äì 75% of the Engineering team live outside London, several of our engineers live outside the UK, and most members of the team joined the company during COVID, when we didn't have the opportunity to meet our colleagues in person for an extended period.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"> </div>\n<div class=\"h3\">About the team and culture</div>\n<p>As a team, we believe in an open, honest and supportive culture to facilitate the most efficient delivery of features for our customers and other stakeholders. We strive for a flat hierarchy (as much as possible) and a culture of trust, autonomy and high context sharing in pursuit of common goals. We don't micro-manage. Instead, we believe empowering our engineers to make their own decisions based on the most accurate information and context is the most efficient mechanism to enable engineers to solve hard technical and customer problems.</p>\n<p>We use a variety of modern technologies to build and operate our platform:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go microservices</li>\n<li>Postgres for data storage (with the option to move to CockroachDB or similar in future)</li>\n<li>Kafka for business event streaming</li>\n<li>We host this infrastructure in Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform, in a platform supported in-house by our Cloud Engineering team.</li>\n<li>On the front-end, we use React for both internal web platforms and React Native for our mobile application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We believe in investing in our staff, so we're in the process of separating people and technical leadership into separate disciplines. When you join Ziglu, you can expect to have a dedicated Engineering Manager (who has a technical background) who looks after your personal development. In addition, we have a horizontal promotion track to recognise and grow exceptional technical talent without expecting people to lead a team. We support opportunities for everyone to take part in leading a squad or major delivery, if they want to, without obligation.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">About you</div>\n<p>We're currently hiring engineers who have several years of experience working in a technology-first organisation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technical success: </strong>You'll have several years of experience building and scaling the backend of a technology product. You don't need to have technical qualifications, such as a degree ‚Äì professional experience is just as beneficial as formal academic study.</li>\n<li><strong>Experimental mindset: </strong>you're comfortable working with limited information as you discover the best way to solve a problem. You recognise that there's rarely one \"correct\" way to solve a problem and that \"best practices\" continually evolve, so you're constantly learning and developing your own knowledge and learning from others to be the best you can.</li>\n<li><strong>Team mindset: </strong>you're a highly empathetic team player who is comfortable working closely with the wider delivery team to ship software. You may have strong opinions on technical discussions and team processes, which you're comfortable to share with others, while also holding opinions weakly and backing the team decision.</li>\n<li><strong>Delivery mindset: </strong>you understand the importance of delivering working software early and often, both for your own satisfaction, the collective team learning, and to deliver on our obligations. You can pragmatically rationalise with others as to the required quality threshold, and you strive to ensure perfect does not become the enemy of good.</li>\n<li><strong>Leadership mindset: </strong>while this isn't formally a leadership role, you recognise that leadership emerges through influence, not authority. You're comfortable expressing your opinions, owning your function, giving feedback (whether positive or constructive) to help colleagues continually improve, and you know when to seek another opinion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don't need you to have any experience with financial services, blockchain or cryptocurrency, as we can provide any training for these aspects once you're working for us, although any experience you do have here is always a bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive Salary</li>\n<li>Free trades for all Ziglu Staff</li>\n<li>Working abroad anywhere</li>\n<li>Possibility of stock options</li>\n<li>25 days holiday (5 days on top of statutory minimum)</li>\n<li>Subsidised healthcare protection</li>\n<li>Working with a great team and the opportunity to help shape company culture!</li>\n<li>Equipment provided</li>\n<li>Cycle to work scheme</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1203066/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"

          "description": "<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Hi üëãüèæ I‚Äôm <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, the Co-Founder and Head of Engineering at Ashby. React (and the libraries that followed) changed how I think about frontend development. Today, building interfaces feels like designing a Lego set. </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">How do I decompose this UI into encapsulated components? What should be a controlled vs. uncontrolled component? How do I refactor the repeated functionality into a more generic component? Should the generic component be a compound component to give the developer flexibility? </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">There‚Äôs great satisfaction when components are easy to read and understand, generic components have the right mix of specificity versus props, and renders are perceivably fast. One side note, we don‚Äôt memoize everything by default ‚Äîonly what matters to performance.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We answer these questions every day at Ashby, and that‚Äôs a consequence of the breadth and depth of the product we‚Äôre building. To ground it with examples, engineers on frontend have built:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A fast mobile web app that solves the critical jobs-to-be-done for hiring managers using newer technologies like <a href=\"https://vitejs.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Vite</u></a> and <a href=\"https://stitches.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Stitches</u></a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A set of UI components to build filters in a domain-specific language with ANDs, ORs, NOTs, and even joins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to add editable fields with minimal effort.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A Google Calendar-like experience to schedule complex interview panels with candidates.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">These projects reflect what we‚Äôre accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We haven‚Äôt launched publicly, but we have many paying customers who love us, and we have great investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I‚Äôll share more once we meet.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">One formality, we do require at least 1.5 years of experience as a full-time software engineer for this role.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Engineering Culture</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Benji</u></a>‚Äôs (my co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (I wrote about it <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>).   </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Increase Leverage, not Team Size</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We‚Äôve done this through investment in:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 5x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience üí™üèæ</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. </strong>At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video on it <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Here‚Äôs an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it‚Äôs like to build a feature at Ashby: </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/4f34daa7-d35f-437d-8d8e-9f189431e3df/arjun.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Give Engineers Ownership &amp; Autonomy</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don‚Äôt get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Put Effort into Diversity </div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Diverse teams <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>drive innovation and better outcomes</u></a>. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It‚Äôs not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Interview Process</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We‚Äôll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds: </p>\n<ol style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">30-minute introduction call (we demo Ashby!)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A technical screen (take home <em>or</em> 75-minute in-person)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A virtual on-site of 3 hours and 30 minutes (can be split across two days) </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. You‚Äôll meet my co-founder and CEO plus 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don‚Äôt give an offer, we‚Äôll provide feedback!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Your First Two Months at Ashby</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. We‚Äôll pair you with a peer who‚Äôll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Technology Stack</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">I‚Äôm sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don‚Äôt require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful üòÄ): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), SCSS modules, Stitches (mobile), React, Apollo GraphQL, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Benefits</div>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Competitive salary and equity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>10-year exercise window for stock options</em>. You shouldn‚Äôt feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby ‚Äîdo it when you feel financially comfortable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect ‚ÄúVacation?‚Äù in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it üòÖ.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US.</em> We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">If you‚Äôre in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Ashby‚Äôs success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We‚Äôre being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><br><br><br></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

Just in case you haven't heard, growing an ecommerce brand often equals with automating human communication (we're looking at you, chat bots). But automation means losing a key piece of the shopping experience: a meaningful connection with customers.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Cartloop is an ecommerce startup that's changing the way people interact with brands. Instead of automated messages (or chat bots), we are helping brands grow independently by adding the human touch throughout the entire shopping experience. The coolest thing is we are growing quickly and possibly have the perfect position for you.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Team and culture</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Cartloop is helping brands win the hearts of their customers by providing a tool that creates personal relationships at scale. To provide a missing pillar of core eCommerce experience, we're building a team of people who are ready to take on some of the most interesting challenges in the industry.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Here are some of our core values to give you a sense of who we are as a team:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Ownership.

It takes courage to take responsibility even in the face of failure. Be an owner and you'll thrive here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Autonomy. We have the ability to unblock ourselves, search for answers before asking for help, and make reasonable decisions within our scope without seeking consensus from others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Customer-first. We understand our customers and optimize to build the best product for them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Product-driven. We're on a mission to building a best-in-class product that will power millions of brands.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Great communication. We prefer an async way of working with a focus on deep work vs. endless meetings and politics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Efficiency. Too many meetings, repetitive tasks, things that simply don't make a difference. We say no to those.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Impact. We take our work seriously.

A desire to contribute to back-end API implementation is welcomed if full stack feature ownership is strongly desired as a preferred way of working, but is very far from an essential requirement.</p>\n<p>While our back-end has heavy test automation investment, we have made substantially less proportional investment on the front-end. The right person will want to lead the charge on paying back tech debt in this area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mote culture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mote is a remote-only startup, comprising a small team distributed across many time zones and locations. We‚Äôre genuinely mission-driven and we find our work exciting and rewarding. There‚Äôs never a shortage of work to do, but we value maintaining work-life balance.</li>\n<li>To excel in this role at Mote, you‚Äôre the kind of person who can prioritise effectively, and then stay in ‚Äòheads down‚Äô mode to get the job done.</li>\n<li>As a member of a remote team, you‚Äôll be happy working independently, but you‚Äôll know how to work collaboratively using asynchronous tools like Mote, Loom and Slack. As a general rule, we try to minimise time spent in scheduled meetings, preferring to ‚Äòjump on a zoom‚Äô to work through a difficult problem when necessary.</li>\n<li>As a ‚ÄòMotey‚Äô, you‚Äôll be expected to challenge colleagues - to push back firmly and politely when you disagree, but you try your best to bring the team along with you by explaining your thinking.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are already a senior front-end engineer or tech lead, with at least 5 years experience at fast-growth consumer and/or SaaS tech companies.</li>\n<li>You have had enough experience of leading or influencing teams as a senior, that you feel you want to take the next step and own more ownership and responsibility in the success of a front-end team.</li>\n<li>Demonstrable command of working with production JavaScript/TypeScript codebases</li>\n<li>You either have formal degree-level training in Computer Science or can demonstrate solid evidence of self-taught solid grasp of fundamentals.</li>\n<li>You have demonstrated you are a high impact individual contributor combining high levels of accuracy, rigour and output.</li>\n<li>You have excellent judgement on engineering trade-offs, with a fine-tuned sense of when to pick between accruing more tech debt, leaving as is but increasing tests, refactoring or wholesale rewriting.</li>\n<li>You have previously championed and lead meaningful investments in test automation (using Jest, Playwright, Cypress etc) and nuanced opinions on test pyramids, ice cream cones and honeycombs.</li>\n<li>You live by the <strong>‚Äúno asshole‚Äù rule</strong>, demonstrating high levels of empathy for peers, non-technical colleagues and users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We have a cut-down version of our web offering in the iOS App Store (built with React Native). This may become an area of increased investment. Experience of React Native is desirable but not essential.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive salary</li>\n<li>Stock option plan</li>\n<li>Leave package</li>\n<li>Work from home</li>\n<li>Flexible hours</li>\n<li>Working with an amazing team</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1156815/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"

The role isn't a machine learning role but the ideal candidate should be interested in the NLP/machine learning space. We're a distributed team that works collaboratively across the globe, we're not quite a remote-first company - but we're pretty close.<em>Your primary responsibility is to independently work on our enterprise software stack for our diverse blue chip clients.

You should be smart and always willing to learn. You'll be able to accept your own limitations and be honest that nobody knows everything, anybody is able to ask for support. You will always be looking for solutions that can speed up workflows. Efficiency is at the top of your mind. You like doing things the \"right\" way, but are pragmatic when you have a deadline.</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1141198/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"

          "description": "<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Hi üëãüèæ I‚Äôm <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, the Co-Founder and Head of Engineering at Ashby. As a person who could design <em>and</em> build software, this is a position close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate <em>in code</em>. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one ‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt design <em>and </em>build. At Ashby, you can.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">While every engineer can design <em>and </em>build, you‚Äôll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate‚Äôs assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">These projects reflect what we‚Äôre accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We haven‚Äôt launched publicly, but we have many paying customers who love us, and we have great investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I‚Äôll share more once we meet.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">One formality, we do require at least 1.5 years of experience as a full-time software engineer for this role.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Engineering Culture</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Benji</u></a>‚Äôs (my co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (I wrote about it <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>). </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Increase Leverage, not Team Size</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We‚Äôve done this through investment in:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 5x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience üí™üèæ</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. </strong>At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video on it <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Here‚Äôs an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it‚Äôs like to build a feature at Ashby: </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/40361ea1-5cdf-48c5-a550-e6f877838c56/arjun.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Give Engineers Ownership &amp; Autonomy</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don‚Äôt get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Put Effort into Diversity </div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Diverse teams <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>drive innovation and better outcomes</u></a>. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It‚Äôs not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Interview Process</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We‚Äôll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds: </p>\n<ol style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">30-minute introduction call (we demo Ashby!)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A technical screen (take home <em>or</em> 75-minute in-person)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A virtual on-site of 3 hours and 30 minutes (can be split across two days) </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. You‚Äôll meet my co-founder and CEO plus 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don‚Äôt give an offer, we‚Äôll provide feedback!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Your First Two Months at Ashby</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. We‚Äôll pair you with a peer who‚Äôll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Technology Stack</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">I‚Äôm sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don‚Äôt require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful üòÄ): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), SCSS modules, Stitches (mobile), React, Apollo GraphQL, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Benefits</div>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Competitive salary and equity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>10-year exercise window for stock options</em>. You shouldn‚Äôt feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby ‚Äîdo it when you feel financially comfortable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect ‚ÄúVacation?‚Äù in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it üòÖ.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US.</em> We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">If you‚Äôre in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Ashby‚Äôs success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We‚Äôre being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><br><br><br></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1135289/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"
